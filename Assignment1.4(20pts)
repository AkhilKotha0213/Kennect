Q) Explain JWT in Approx and it's top three benefits

A)     What is JWT

   * JWT(JSON Web Token) is a JSON object which is mainly used for autherization(to securely transfer information over the web using RFC 7519 standard)
   * JWT is used for authentication system and can be used for exachange of information.
   * JWT autherization is more secured than the traditional session token authentication(uses cookies for authentication data)
     because it uses encrypted JSON web tokens for authentication
   
      How JWT works
   * During user login system, user logins through client(Browser) by posting the login service to the client(browser) like email id and password and this login request
     will be sent to the server. The server creates JWT with a secret key for the request and send it back to the browser(client) which can be stored in different ways
     (e.g cookie). Now if the user send any other request to the server with the JWT, server will check the JWT with secret key and authenticates the user. 
   * JWT mainly consists of 
                            1) Header
                            2) Payload
                            3) Signature
   * The encoded version of token contains encoded charcters seperated by "."
   * Header:    consists of algorithim to encode and decodes the JWT and the type(here it is JWT).
   * Payload:   consists all th information stored in the token.
   * Signature: consists of secret key for verification.
   
     Advantages
     
   * Authentication for multiple requests from the same or sub server can be done automatically without logging in again using JWT.
   * Authentication will be done automatically for different sessions since the JWT stores in the browser(client).
   * Used in micro services.
